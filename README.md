# Startpages

A collection of usually self-contained pages I've made in my off-time. Edit as you wish, a credit would be nice though.

Most of these pages depend on _elkCSS_, the older version, contained in the root dir as `elk.css`. Some newer ones depend on the newer version which you can get at: <https://elkcss.netlify.com>
